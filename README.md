# Project Description:

This project is an automated irrigation system designed for home gardening. The system uses soil moisture sensors, an Arduino, and a submersible water pump to automatically water plants when soil moisture drops below a certain point (30% in our case).


# Features:

Automatic watering based on soil moisture

Real-time monitoring using soil moisture sensor

Wi-Fi module for controlling the system through the app

I2C LCD display



# Hardware Used:

Arduino Uno

Wi-Fi module

Soil moisture sensor

MOSFET

Relay module

Water pump

Jumper wires

Tubing + Reservoir
